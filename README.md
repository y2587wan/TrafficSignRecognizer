# TrafficSignRecognizer
Inspiration
Plan to participate driving course

What it does
Recognize the traffic sign, (currently only with stop sign and school zone sign)

How I built it
Unity with AR vuforia

Challenges I ran into
Unity Location Service is not accurate Looks good on the computer and looks bad on the phone 
It is difficult to use a new language to make API call

Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Understand how api is working

What I learned
Machine learning is better than AR

What's next for TrafficSignRecognizer
Post location update for sign in the database when it is new with API post 
Get sign when passing location when location is stored in the database with API get Add more sign 
Use Tensorflow Object Detection instead of AR
